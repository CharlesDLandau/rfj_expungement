# Rising for Justice Expungement

The Expungement Eligibility Guide app is a brand new project being created with [Rising For Justice](https://risingforjustice.org/). RFJ is a DC organization that runs legal clinics where residents can get help having their criminal records expunged.
This repository has the source code for a complex web form. The form encodes logic developed by [Rising for Justice](https://www.risingforjustice.org) to help pro bono lawyers evaluate whether their client is eligible to have their criminal record expunged.

## Discalaimer
This is not a self service tool. `rfj_expungement` is being developed in conjunction with The Rising for Justice organization and is meant to be used within Washington DC. Please talk to your lawyer for any legal advice.

## For Clinics
You are free to use this code for your needs as stated in our [license](LICENSE.md). Please remember that this application is made to be used in Washington DC. You will need to modify it to fit your needs in your jurisdiction.
